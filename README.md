# Kickstarter-analysis
Analysis on the kickstarter campaign data 

## Overview of Project

Kickstarter campaign is an initiative that helps creaters in different industries like theatre, food, music, photography etc. change their dreams into reality by getting financial backing of other community members. 

### Purpose

We are here to help our client Louise launch her first kickstarter project in the theatre/plays category. Our analysis will help Louise make a more informed decision. Historically, plays have had a 61% sucess rate. Refer to the images below. Hence, if we can further analyze kickstarter data then we can decide on few key aspects before Louise can start her own campaign.

Goal: A successful campaign for our client. 

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Number of campaigns with pleadges excluding the live projects : 1369
Projects that met their goals : 61%
Projects failed to meet goals : 36%

You can see an upward trend between April and May. This means that projects that were launched in the month of May had a good success rate compared to rest of the year. We do need more data to analyze why this happened. Looking at the goal amount can give us further idea.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Here we are only considering "Plays" category as that's the subcategory that we are interested in. When we look at the data, it gives us a fair understanding of how the projects faired based on their goal amounts. There was 50% chance of success or failure if the goal amount was between $15000 - $19999. Kickstarter campaign as a whole has been more successful if the goal amount was on a lower end preferably between $1000 to $4999. 

That being said, there have been projects which have been successful with higher goal amount as well. There could be so many other factors playing role for eg: a particular genre of play could be of more interest to the backers than another.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Putting data into words has been most challending thus far. To overcome that, I went online to read more about such campaigns and what data these campaigning websites provide to their customers. 

## Summary

- Outcomes based on Launch Dates

  1. The percentage of successful projects has somewhat been consistent thoughout the year except for a slight drop between Oct and Dec.
  2. We do see a major spike in projects launched in the month of May though sucess rate is still similar to other months. Looking at the data, month in which a project is launched may not be playing a very crucial role.

- Outcomes based on Goals

  1. A project of Theater/Play category has good chance to succeed if its goal amount has been set anywhere between $1000 to $4999. Refer to data above.

- Limitations of dataset

  Anyone who's project has a higher goal amount doesn't have sufficient data to understand the factors that might result in the success or failure of their project. 

- Possibilities
  
  1. One important data that we didnt consider is number of successful/failed project by currency. A project that might need $1000 in US might need suppose $6000 in another country. Do the people in that country have that spending capacity?
  2. Another way to look at the data is through backers count. Does less backer count necessarily mean a failed project?
