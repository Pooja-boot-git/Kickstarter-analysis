# Kickstarter-analysis
Analysis on the kickstarter campaign data 

## Overview of Project

Kickstarter campaign is an initiative that helps creaters in different industries like theatre, food, music, photography etc. change their dreams into reality by getting financial backing of other community members. 

### Purpose

We are here to help our client Louise launch her first kickstarter project in the theatre/plays category. Our analysis will help Louise make a more informed decision.

Goal: A successful campaign for our client. 

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Number of campaigns with pleadges excluding the live projects : 1369
Projects that met their goals : 61%
Projects failed to meet goals : 36%

You can see an upward trend between April and May. This means that projects that were launched in the month of May had a good success rate compared to rest of the year. We do need more data to analyze why this happened. Looking at the goal amount can give us further idea.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Here we are only considering "Plays" category as that's the subcategory that we are interested in. When we look at the data, it gives us a fair understanding of how the projects faired based on their goal amounts. There was 50% chance of success or failure if the goal amount was between $15000 - $19999. Kickstarter campaign as a whole has been more successful if the goal amount was on a lower end preferably between $1000 to $4999. 

That being said, there have been projects which have been successful with higher goal amount as well. There could be so many other factors playing role for eg: a particular genre of play could be of more interest to the backers than another.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
